        # Login rate limiter: 30 attempts per 5 minutes per IP (6 per minute average)
        # Provides DoS protection against mass login attempts from single IP
        # Account lock (at 5 attempts) provides primary brute force protection
        # Uses sliding window for more accurate enforcement
        # Higher limit allows multiple users on same IP (e.g., shared network) without issues
