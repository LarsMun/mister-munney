        # Login rate limiter: 10 attempts per 5 minutes per IP
        # Much stricter than general API limit to prevent brute force attacks
        # Uses sliding window for more accurate enforcement
        # Limit is set to 10 to allow account lock (at 5 attempts) to trigger first
        # Account lock is more user-friendly (email unlock) than rate limit (wait 5 min)
